Sprint 5 Reflection

Sprint 5 was our strongest sprint. We communicated well, did 
our code reviews early, and implemented a whole lot of new
mechanics while continuing to improve upon the mechanics
from Sprint 4. Everyone did well in sprint 5.
We got the boss level itself working in the first week
of the sprint, and spent the rest of the time on
implementing the boss fight itself, the new power-ups,
and bug fixes and optimization.
The new boss level works well, and we are proud of the
boss fight we created and the variety of mechanics that
it uses.
