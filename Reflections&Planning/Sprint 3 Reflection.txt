Sprint 3 Reflection

In Sprint 3 we were more organized, making use of GitHub issues to track who was doing what and starting on the code earlier than we did in Sprint 2. The level loader, state changes, camera, and mouse controls were made without too much trouble, but we had a lot of issues with collision. We've fixed a lot of collision bugs, but Mario still sometimes clips through blocks or pipes, so fixing collision is on our backlog for Sprint 4. We also failed to submit our code in time to receive a code review, so we really need to submit for code review earlier during the last few sprints.
