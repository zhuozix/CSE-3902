Sprint 4 Reflection

In Sprint 4 we completed our tasks well. We fixed all the bugs that the collision had from Sprint 3.
We finished the sound early, around spring break. We faced some bugs trying to make flag at the
end of the level work, but we fixed it. The underground level and HUD worked well with no major bugs.
Everyone did a great job in Sprint 4.
All the features of Level 1-1 are realized, we prioritized implementing all functionality first and
then did a lot of testing and bug fixing.
We've been using issues to organize our tasks, but haven't really implemented the project board still.
