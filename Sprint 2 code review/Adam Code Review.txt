We should make the controller for everything, not just the keyboard. We should also think about whether we want to do multiplayer for our game because they controller is
hard coded for single player only right now. The controller also reaches into game a lot and assumes a lot about states which falls under the class-level code smell
inappropriate intimacy.  
Other than these small things, KeyboardController.cs has a great design and helps make a lot of things easier within the Mario game. The other class-level code smells
such as cyclomatic complexity, downcasting, data clump, large class, and refused bequest are all not present in this class.
