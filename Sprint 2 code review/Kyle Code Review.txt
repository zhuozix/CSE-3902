Quality
This code does it's job well. The sprite is updated at a good speed, the if else loops are simple but effective to make the star bounce, and it moves at a good speed.
There are some magic numbers in there that should be pulled out and made into a data problem at some point but it should be fine for now.

Readability
The code is organized and the variable names are clear so I can read what the code is doing, but it could benefit from some comments.
