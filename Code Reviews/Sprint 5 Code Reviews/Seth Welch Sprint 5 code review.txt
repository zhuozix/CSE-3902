This class was made necessary as we created a second level separate from 1-1 to house our boss fight. This class was well written in its simplicity. 
It consists of initializing the game objects which are all named appropriately to make it easy to read.

Kyle did a good job on improving the camera method by moving magic numbers pertaining to camera barriers in the level to the xml level file. 
This improved earlier problems with the camera class being tailored to the level instead of being data driven. This was necessary since we added 
the boss level which has different barriers.
