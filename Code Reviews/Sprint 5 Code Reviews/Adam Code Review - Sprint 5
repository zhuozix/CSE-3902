The organization of this code is good. The elements of code that are similar are all 
grouped together which demonstrates high cohesion. However, the code could use comments
to increase the readability.

The overall logic of the code is good. Some things that would improve it are 
cutting down on the repetition and also getting rid of some magic numbers.
we could also condense all of the data into collections so that the logic
is separated from the data. Overall, this is a good class with good logic.
