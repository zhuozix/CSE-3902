This code is organized well so it's fine in readability, but there are a lot
of magic numbers that could be replaced with variables to make reading and
managing this code easier. It currently has no comments, so some comments
could be added to clerify what the code is doing.

This implementation of fireballs sends the fireballs too fast, they end up going
over the heads of most enemies and not hitting anything. We wanted this mode to
make mario fire fireballs faster, as in he fires more of them, not just that the
fireballs move faster.
I'd slow the super fireballs vertical movement down some, and speed up their 
horizontal movement, so they still move faster but they also bounce faster so they 
hit enemies. Then change the factory to fire a burst of 2 or 3 fireballs whenever a
super fireball is fired so that firing once can hit multiple enemies or deals more 
damage to the boss.
