Specific comments:

In the "runnungLeft", "runnungRight", "jump", and "fall" methods, 
there is a typo in the method names. It should be "running" instead of "runnung".
Methods "toIdleState", "toRunningState", "toJumpingState", and "toFallingState" are very clear 
and easy to use with a single call. Esay to maintain and people can target bug esayly if there is 
something wrong with jump or run.
