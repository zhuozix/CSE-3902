Specific comments on code quality:
MovingEnemy.cs is to give initialize the value of enemy sprite, has slightly coupling. There is no problem for sprint2, but after that, goomba and koopa should have their own concrete class, and they have different states when interacting with Mario. And the code about the moving sprite in it is not applicable to the later sprints, and needs to be rewritten later.
