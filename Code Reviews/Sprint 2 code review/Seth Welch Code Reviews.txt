Quality
All of the methods for Mario are really short which makes them well written. The method bodies being short shows that the Mario class does not do more than it should
and instead lets the state pattern design handle things. The exception to this would the heavy use of switch cases in the findLocation() method. These switch cases 
make use of hardcoded strings that could be avoided. I think the work on Mario.cs is very impressive and the coding is very clever.

Readability
I think the readability of this file could be greatly improved by moving all of the objects stored here into a sort of object manager so that all update and draw calls
do  not need to be made individually. Ideally, the game file should be less cluttered and have less responsibilities. We will all be sure to work on this next Sprint.
