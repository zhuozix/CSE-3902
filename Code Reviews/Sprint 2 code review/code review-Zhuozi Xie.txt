Specific comments on code quality:
This code implementation of the factory pattern, providing a SpritesFactory class to produce various sprite objects in the game. The organizational structure of the code is relatively clear, and the function realization is also relatively clear. However, there are many magic values in the code, these values should be defined as constants or enumerations to improve the maintainability of the code.
