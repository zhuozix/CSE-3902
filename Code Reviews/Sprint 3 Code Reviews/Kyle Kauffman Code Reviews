Variable names are clear and understandable, the code is well organized. It's good, readable code that doesn't
take too long to figure out, but it does completely lack comments. I understand the enemy, goomba, koopa and
koopa shell transitions, but I don't know what push mario is being used for here, some comments could explain.

The code is functional but the item blocks generate items completely randomly, which is not how those are
suppose to work. Instead of randomly generating an item, we could change the item blocks to have a value
that dictates what item is inside of them, and then instead of randomly generating a number the generateItem
function could generate an item based on that value.
