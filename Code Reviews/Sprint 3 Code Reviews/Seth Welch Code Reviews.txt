This class is very straightforward and readable. There aren't manu variables being used but they are well named making them self explanitory. There is little complexity
to the method and the conditions in the logic are math based so it makes it easy to tell what triggers the translation of the camera.

This class is very simple in the way that it knows its job and does it without much complexity. One note is that in the fall() method there is a case of 2 nested 'if' statements that should easily be changed to a single 'if' statement by combining the conditions. There is also a heavy use of magic numbers to control the movement
of the fireballs. This unnecesarry complexity was the only issue I had with this code.
