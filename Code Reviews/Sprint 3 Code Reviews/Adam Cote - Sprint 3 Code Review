This class follows good readability practices. The attributes that are similar are grouped together which is a sign of high cohesion.
The code could benefit from comments, but other than that it has high readability.

The quality of this code is very high. It doesn't set off any of the class level code smells. It is a good size and fulfills its function
in the project very well.
