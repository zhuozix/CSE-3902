The code would benefit from more comments, especially to explain the purpose of the methods. 
The name of the varibales are easy to understand.

The koopaTransition() and gommbaTransition() methods share some common code, such as removing the current enemy object from the enemies list. 
It's a good idea to refactor the code to remove the duplicate code and improve code reuse.
The code structure also very good. The changeState() method calls the appropriate transition method based on the name of the enemy object.
