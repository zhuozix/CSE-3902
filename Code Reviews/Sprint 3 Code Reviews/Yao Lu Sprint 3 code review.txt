Overall, the code seems to be written in a readable content.

Specific comments on code quality:
Still have some magic number exists, but it will be fixed in next sprint. For the generateItem() method, 
it has too many if and else, which makes it hard to understand and maintain. 
For the variables like blockSprite, factory could be private variables.
Overall the code is clear and following the requirements of code smell.
