The loadSounds method initializes the class's static fields with sounds loaded from the content manager. 
It is a good practice to load all the required content at the beginning of the game or level to avoid delays during gameplay.
The playMainTheme method plays the main theme music and sets it to repeat. 
This is appropriate for music that should play continuously during the game.
