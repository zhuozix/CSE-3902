Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

This code is very simple and easy to follow because the only job of the title screen is to draw an image and check for input, but I feel as though the check for the 
enter key should belong somewhere else like the keyboard controller and complicates the update method.

This code is very high quality and simple. The ui Draw method utilizes a separate spritebatch from the rest of the game to prevent it from moving which is a clever 
way of addresssing that issue. This class only deals with displaying the ui and does not concern itself with controlling the values in the UI which is good separation 
of responsibility. The only few magic numbers in this class are unchanging position numbers that could be removed in the future.
