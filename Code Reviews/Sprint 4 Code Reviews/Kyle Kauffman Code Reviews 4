This code is well organized and easy to decipher and understand, but could benefit from
some comments to label the code explicity.

This code is now much better, both in organization and function. Moving all the different types of
collisions into their own files was a good decision. Collide.cs itself is now much simpler. I think
the MarioAndNPC file is still doing a lot though, and would benefit from being further decomposed
into smaller files handling the different collisions between Mario and blocks, mario and enemies, etc.
Also the file name has a typo, the extra 'i' should be removed.
