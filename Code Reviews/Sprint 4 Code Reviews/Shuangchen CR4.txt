The style of the code is unified with the rest of the class. 
Following the design specifications of the factory pattern makes the entire code particularly clean to read. 
All the method names and variable names have meaning and allow others to know what each method is supposed to do without any comments.
I think the code is very readable.

The code is well aligned with the rest of the action pattern in sprint2. 
The code is very simple, when Mario touches the flagpole he has a downward acceleration. 
But there are too many empty methods in the code. 
The point of these empty methods is that Mario can't move or enter other states once he enters pole side mode. 
But these methods can be hidden. 
Then I thought it would be a good idea to use the update() method to go to the next state, 
so that Mario could be guaranteed to win without any problems. 
In the meantime any other commands are locked to ensure no bugs are created.
