Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Overall, the code seems to be written in a readable content. 
The indentation and spacing are consistent and make the code easy to read, the variable and method names are generally
descriptive and easy to understand.
The Enter() method initializes the Camera, loads a level, adds a player object, and loads commands into the controllers. It 
does too many things, could break into smaller methods.

too many magic numbers,should be replaced with a named constant to make it easier to maintain.
It uses Mario as parameter would be better to simply pass in the player's position as a parameter 
instead of the entire Mario object.
could use Math.Min() and Math.Max() to make the camera position to a specific range.
