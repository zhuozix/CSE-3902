Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

This code is very well formatted and easy to read and understand at first glance. The code would benefit from more commenting however.
Adding captions to the methods and variables would round off this class and make it very readable.

As for the code quality, the code is pretty good logic for detecting collisions. 
One critique I would make is that magic numbers should be made into variables.
Other than that, this class is very good quality and is a large contributor to
making the game work and function correctly.
