Sprint 2 Reflection

Adam's reflection: 
At the start of the sprint a burndown chart was made dividing up all of the different tasks that were needed to be completed for sprint 2. I was assigned with the task
of creating the block objects and outputing them to the screen. Overall, the team did a great job of keeping everyone updated on their individual progress on their task
from the burndown chart. I wouldn't make any changes to our strategy of this for the next sprint. 

As for the process as a whole, the team developed into the Sprint 2 branch directly, which I thought was easier to do then merge requests and conflicts, we could discuss
as a team which we'd rather do. Everything considered, I think our team handled Sprint 2 very well and when we take into account Professor Kirby's code review comment we
will have a solid foundation created.
