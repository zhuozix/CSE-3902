Planning was originally in README file but was replaced with a proper README file with controls for the program.

The Plan:
  Kyle: Creating interfaces (or you can let the person responsible for each part of the implementation choose when to provide interfaces).
  
  Yao: Handling Link's state transitions.
  
  Zhuozi: Creating enemy classes.
  
  Adam: Creating item classes.
  
  Seth: Creating block class(es).
  
  Shuangchen: Implementing commands and controllers, implement keyboard input.

Note: Adam and Seth switched jobs from the original plan early in the process.
